## AGENTIC FLOW FOR INTERVIEW BOT

### Workflow

1. An initial question is asked to the user. Like " tell me about yourself"
2. user will respond to that question.
3. based on user response a score is decided.
4. based on user_response and score , next question is generated.

This is a really basic setup for a agentic system.
